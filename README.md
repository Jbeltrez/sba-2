-The project requirements were to replicate a figma design using CSS and a framework/ library like bootstrap or Tailwind 
-I used bootstrap utility classes mainly for the layout and then used the assets provided like coloring 
-pictures and fonts. The project required to use Bootstrap components where applicable but going beyond utility classes was unneccessary.
